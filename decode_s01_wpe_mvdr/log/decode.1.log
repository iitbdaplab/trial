S01_mvdr_ta they should in use today was not invented until the sixteenth century before that mathematics was written out in words limiting mathematical discovery either seventeen zero seven to seventeen eighty three was responsible for many of the notation in use today modern notation makes mathematics much easier for the professional but beginners often find it daunting according to the fact that mathematical ideas are both more abstract and more encrypted than those of natural than those of natural language unlike natural language where people can often equate a word such as cow with the physical object it corresponds to mathematical symbols are abstract lacking any physical analog mathematical symbols are also more highly encrypted than regular words meaning a number of different operations or ideas moreover mathematical language can be difficult to understand for beginners because common terms such as or and only have more precise meanings than in everyday speech and other common terms such as open and field refer to specific mathematical ideas not related to their usual meanings mathematical language also includes many technical terms such as more than and in that have no meaning outside of mathematics sense the term modern physics means up to date physics in this sense a significant portion of so called classical physics is modern however since roughly eighteen nineteen new discoveries have caused significant paradigm shifts the advent of quantum mechanics and all sign seem to date physics that incorporates elements of either on the mechanics on and similar or both is said to be modern physics is this latter sense that the term is generally used modern physics is often encountered when dealing with extreme conditions quantum mechanical effects tend to appear when dealing with lows low temperatures small distances right a related effects tend to appear when dealing with highs high village cities large distances the middle being classical easier for example when analyzing the year of a gas at room temperature most phenomena will involve the classical maxwell small distribution however near absolute zero the maxwell was distribution fails to account for the observed be of the gas and the modern for me that or bose einstein distributions have to be used instead very often it is possible to find the classical be by analyzing the modern description at low speeds and large distances when doing so the result is called the classical limit started for the curriculum list again history of those objects and phenomena and their evolution for all all it later a lot of all over or er or really more generally all similar order good all search for a related but distinct subject discuss the server earlier server for a lot of the oldest of the natural sciences the positions in recorded history such as the is there is chinese maya and many ancient indigenous peoples of the americas performed methodical observations of the night sky historically astronomy is there are search for the history of calendars but at low offers go there are get for this are slow theatres stress office are there are physics
