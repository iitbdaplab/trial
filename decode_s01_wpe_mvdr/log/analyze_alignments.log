The optional-silence phone sil occupies 33.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 96.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 33.7% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 10.9% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (5,11.5,47)
