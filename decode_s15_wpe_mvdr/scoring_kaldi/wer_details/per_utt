how   does  www  work  hypertext  markup  language  ***   i   mail   you     my   www  guide  after  carsten  www  is  explained  in  ghouls  stuff   ill  email  the  important  docs  at  my  end   no   do   it  yourself  ill  need  everything   in  pure  text  when   you   have   got   a   first  draft  you  can  email   it   to  the  curriculum  list  and   we  can  talk  about   it  next  saturday  okay  fine  what  happened  to  the  list  by  the  way   it  became  dead     it     seems  except  for  the  suggestions  for  courses  which  were  interesting  this  should  liven  things  up   so   what   about  right  how  many  gna  faqs  are  there  maybe  carsten  can  informally  coordinate  gna  curriculum  until   i    am  back  to   vr  together  with  joseph  please  i   am  too  new  to  this  ok  let  me  see  if  i  have  all  the  projects  straight  has  also  volunteered  some  time  ago   to  participate   in   a   draft  for   the  curriculum  i  don't  know  how  much   he  really  wants   to  get  involved  though  but   it   is  nice  that   he   is  not   a    cs   or  natural  science  person  edit  transcript  of  this  meeting  carsten  writeup   gna  faq   me   announce  meetings  and  get  consultants  list  working  again  get  global  village  up  and  running  finish  thesis  and  prepare  for  teaching  programming  class  next  semester  will  pack  the  curriculum  stuff  for  ftp  joseph  and  water  carsten  carstens  ground  with  what  other  info  i  have  laying  around  thank  you  don't  forget  to  update  the  www  page  ok  and  ill  add  his  stuff   to  the  hierachy  also  ill  see   if  i   can  get   a  course  catalog  together  by  next  saturday  which  should  be  appended   to  the  faq   he  wonders  what   role   he    will   play   in  the  gna  concept  i  will  mail  the  litprog  class  proposal  today  to   be  included  you  should  mark  the  other  two  c  plus   ***  plus  parallel  with  ***   ***    ***    provided  collaborators  can  be  found  through  related  newsgroups  no  interaction  without  them  i  mean  with  interlude  actually   i   think  that  the  course  catalog  should   be   a   separate  documents  for  now  since  its  likely   to   be  very  heavily  revised  ok  lots  of  stuff   to   do   i    am  off  guys  thanks  for  the  meeting  and  keep  up  the  good  work  especially  thanks  to  joseph   ***   ***  for  keeping    the    organization  together  i  think  we  can  tenetatively  plan    to    use  interlude  for  the  classes  and  use  as  a  backup  explain  interlude  the  question   is  continue  working   on  the  gna  lab   or  start  learning  interlude  full  speed   if  there   are   serious  problems  with  using  global  village  and  interlude   we  should   be  aware   of  them   by  early  january  and   this  will   give   us  enough  time   to  switch  i  think  the  best  thing  is  to  talk  with  some  more  and  decide  for  yourself  where  your  time  would   be   best  spent  i  already  got  a  programmers  ***  manual  he  seems  to  think  that   ***  interlude   is  a  better  basis  for  ***  inter  moo  communications  i  don't  know  enough  about  that  to  comment  on  that  okay  people  ill  email  you  for  some  things  and  questions  that   i   have  i  just  think  that   me  writing  the  faq  might   be   a   good  idea  since  i  have   to  ask  as  well  perhaps  the  best  thing   to   do   is  to  post  the  question  on  the  gna  tech  list  and  see  what  consensus  emerges   who    is    the  techincal  main  honcho  trauma  gustavo  here  or  colman  gna  tech  is  very  silent  lately  carsten  means  the  most  well  versed  person   so   is  the  curriculum  one  really  then   we  need   to  make   it   noisy  again  ill  look  forward  to  the  comments  on  the  ***  first  draft  after  the  weekend  then  bye  guys  should   we  adjourn  the  meeting
