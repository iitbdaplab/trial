S15_mvdr_ta ok maybe carsten can got any of that due to lack of time me and the things up by sturgeons hierarchy i actually i do yup just back to be fine you can when can everyone mail me absolutely all documentation maybe there www guide and the info note on the moo to fit that's it i don't have the guide for all selective ftp i have to done list though to myself which takes another day to download ok i will send you or i can be for to what about www can you read the mosaic josephs doc carsten curses his predicament i will not be much around for to three months off my out on that me i all raw html i can be an ftp be done be there by you have www if so i can mail you the addresses of the important documents if not then i can mail you the docs themselves reach them it to lack markup language are let what other guide up the got the www is explained in ghouls stuff i'll email the important docs at my end know where your time for lots draft for all me ok by what happened to the list by the way if together full except for the suggestions for courses which were interesting things up the water course right how many gna faq of the maybe coordinate gna back to the list i too new to the ok let me see if i all the projects straight back likely i will give on the any of this meeting got full of this announce meetings and get consultants list working again get global village up for teaching programming class need back the curriculum stuff for ftp joseph and water carsten curses with what other info i have laying around you forget to update the www page ok and i just off is i will together by next make should be you other for courses play the for i will mail the list role lots of the were you should mark the other two c plus list by the with for work without very does can be found through related newsgroups no interaction without them i mean for now day ok lots of stuff for the off guys thanks for the way keep up the good work especially to joseph will give old i'll village will good i think we can there his things and due for the classes and use as a backup explain inter you problems with using global village inter do things us reach i full the who is to talk with so and decide for yourself where to by were list by i already got a programmers by role he seems to think that need to get a better basis for the do moo communications i will back to comment on that i can i as a better the best also if so for the question on the list and see what consensus emerges with update the good main honcho trauma gustavo here or colman gna tech a very silent lately monday as i look forward to the comments on the for the off of the weekend then for the meeting
