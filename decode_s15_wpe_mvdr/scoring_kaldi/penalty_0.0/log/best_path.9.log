S15_mvdr_ta ok maybe carsten can got any of you lack of time me things up by sturgeons hierarchy i actually i do yup just if i have to when can everyone mail me absolutely all documentation www guide and the info note on the moo to fit that's it i don't have the guide for all selective ftp happened to myself which takes another day to download ok i will send you or i can be for to what about www can you read the mosaic josephs doc carsten curses his predicament i will not be much around for to three months off my out on that me i raw html i can be an ftp be done be by you have www if so i can mail you the addresses of the important documents if not then i can mail you the docs themselves reach today to lack markup language guide up the got the www is explained in ghouls stuff i'll email the important docs at my end know lots draft for all me ok by what happened to the list by the way together full except for the suggestions for courses which were interesting things up the water all the faq of the maybe coordinate gna back to the list i for the ok let me see if i all the projects straight likely i will give on the any of this meeting got of this announce meetings and get consultants list working again get global village up for teaching programming class need back the curriculum stuff for ftp joseph and water carsten curses with what other info i have laying around you forget to update the www page ok and i just off is i will should be you other for courses that i will mail the list role lots of the were you should mark the other two c plus list by the with for work without very does can be found through related newsgroups no interaction without them i mean for now day ok lots of stuff for the off guys for the way keep up the good work especially to joseph will give old i'll village will good i think we can things and due for the classes and use as a backup explain inter you problems with using global day to switch i full the to talk with so and decide for yourself where to i will list by i already got a programmers he seems to thing to get a better basis for the do moo communications i will back to comment on that i have the best to the question on the list and see what consensus emerges with main honcho trauma gustavo here or the gna a very silent lately i look forward to the comments on the after the weekend then for the meeting
