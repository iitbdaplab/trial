S15_mvdr_ta carsten can got any of lack of time me sturgeons actually i just when can everyone mail me absolutely all documentation www guide and the info note on the moo to that's it i don't have the guide on ftp happened to myself which takes another day to download ok i will send you what i can reach today what about www can you read the mosaic josephs doc carsten curses his predicament i will not be much around for to three months on that me raw html be an ftp do you have www if so i can mail you the addresses of the important documents if not then i can mail you the docs themselves guide up the www is explained in ghouls stuff the important docs at my know me ok by the list by the way except for the suggestions for courses which were interesting all the faq the maybe back to the list ok let me see if i all the projects straight maybe carsten announce meetings and get consultants list working again get global village up programming class back the curriculum stuff for ftp joseph and water carsten curses with what other info i have laying around for ok i just stuff you what role lots you should mark the other two c plus list by the info i can be found through related newsgroups no interaction without them on the ok lots of stuff for the off guys keep up the especially to joseph will give i think that due for the classes and use as a backup explain problems with need to switch the to talk with so i will list by i already got a programmers he seems to thing to get a better basis for the moo communications i am back to comment on that i have to the question on the list and see what consensus emerges with main honcho trauma gustavo here or the gna a i look forward to the comments on the off guys
