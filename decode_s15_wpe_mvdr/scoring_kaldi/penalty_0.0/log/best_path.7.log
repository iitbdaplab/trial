S15_mvdr_ta ok maybe carsten can got any of stuff you lack of guys time fit me and the things up by sturgeons hierarchy i actually i do yup just back to be fine you can carsten when can everyone mail me absolutely all documentation maybe there www guide and the info note on the moo to fit that's it my i don't have the guide for all selective ftp i have to done list though to myself which takes another day to download ok i will send you or i can be for to what about www can you read the mosaic josephs doc carsten curses his predicament i will not be much around for to three months off might be a draft out on that me i all raw html i can be an ftp this should be done be there by you have www if so i can mail you the addresses of the important documents if not then i can mail you the docs themselves reach them it to lack markup language are let what other guide up the got the www is explained in ghouls stuff i'll email the important docs at my end know the where your time for lots draft you for and about it me ok by what happened to the list by the way if together full except for the suggestions for courses which were interesting things up the water course right how many gna faq of the maybe i think you on coordinate gna with am back to the list i too new to the ok let me see if i all the projects straight time able to back likely i will give on will might any of this meeting got full of this announce meetings and get consultants list working again just global village up for teaching programming class need read back the curriculum stuff for ftp joseph and water carsten courses all with what other info i have laying around you are forget to update the www page ok and i just off is i will together by next make should be for guys you you other for courses play the for i will mail the list role lots of the when to were you should mark the other two c plus list by the with for work without very does can be found through related are new to no interaction without them i am off read for now he can be day ok lots of stuff for the i off guys thanks for the way be a keep up the good will especially thanks to joseph will give old i'll village will good i think we can there his doc things and due for the classes and use as a backup explain inter you problems with you need do what day to think or us reach i full the who is to talk with so and decide for yourself where to by were list by i already got a programmers by role he seems to think that need to get a better basis for the do moo communications i have laying up back to comment on that i can guys i as a better the best also if so for the question on the list of to what consensus emerges with update the good main honcho role my gustavo here or colman gna tech a very silent lately when to let i look forward to the comments on the for the off off or the weekend then for the meeting
