S15_mvdr_ta carsten can got any of you lack of time me things up by sturgeons i actually i do yup just if i when can everyone mail me absolutely all documentation www guide and the info note on the moo to that's it i don't have the guide for ftp happened to myself which takes another day to download ok i will send you or i can reach today what about www can you read the mosaic josephs doc carsten curses his predicament i will not be much around for to three months on that me raw html i can be an ftp be done be you have www if so i can mail you the addresses of the important documents if not then i can mail you the docs themselves html markup language guide up the got the www is explained in ghouls stuff i'll email the important docs at my know lots draft for all me ok by water list by the way together full except for the suggestions for courses which were interesting water all the faq the maybe back to the list for the ok let me see if i all the projects straight i will any of this meeting got of this announce meetings and get consultants list working again get global village up for teaching programming class need back the curriculum stuff for ftp joseph and water carsten curses with what other info i have laying around forget to update the www page ok i just off guys you for courses role lots were you should mark the other two c plus list by the with for work without very can be found through related newsgroups no interaction without them i mean for now ok lots of stuff for the off guys keep up the good work especially to joseph will give old i'll village will good i think we can things and due for the classes and use as a backup explain due problems with need to switch i full the to talk with so and decide for yourself where to i will list by i already got a programmers he seems to thing to get a better basis for the do communications i will back to comment on that i have the best to the question on the list and see what consensus emerges with main honcho trauma gustavo here or the gna a very actually i look forward to the comments on the after the weekend then for the meeting
