S09_ch1 i am you i am speaker one eastern meeting to meet you yesterday very impressed oh and i noticed last job was just a few blocks from you must like this area right thank you and thank you for seeing me yes i worked right up on street street state street i find it of go there to working in an easy commute for them so you boss last two jobs having lot of similarities with me have open yes they do benefit of better for this opening had solid experience in all dimensions of the job this job seem to be modern situation by the job function is pretty similar i think the company situation would required number of different my present job i feel stiff stifled in that i need to strictly say them on the bounds of my job description i cant really interact with people departments for example without going through my boss is not a bad person but there are limits to on again and found on the job i performed with my job and contributed a lot but promotions and pay increases are slow and make on from really an environment where seniority matters at least as much as performance vote to get a better compensation package don't have an exact figure in my mind but to move from situation that i am very security i would have to be attractive earning now my base pay then the meeting like this plus my bonus can and other fifteen percent also like money for more than anyone else in my office have led my clients aggressively into other new investments this has not only let to slightly higher returns but beginners the the and i even more importantly tighten my relationship with them and built their trust with me have shared this with couple other managers in my office have started to follow this model on what my boss i on on job was that was used was mostly i met with him a lot and learn from from you want to specific objectives and was all will be there any important with what unlike make are was that he was constantly checking upon me so when on the moo interacted directly with other departments was internal we needed him informed of substantive issues and any interactions with other departments that might matter so i would say this was excellent more on how to get my best work of meet once one and and working reason scientists and i respect them late some of my colleges i don't feel in my job is to sell them new there is my value added to them is to educate them about new order and then let them decide whether it was or them is ground situation view is being unique each one really return profile and each one day to learn among the time and education to do is to considering a new or and only which were when the same name new products has over time become the i used in the office my clients respect me as for them my early underscore this role lunch i need or and you shock all in my many work
