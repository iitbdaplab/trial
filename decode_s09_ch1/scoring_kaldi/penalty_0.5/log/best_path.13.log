S09_ch1 i am speaker one yesterday last job was few blocks from you must thank you think you for seeing on street street state street working easy commute for them last two jobs similarities have open yes for this opening had solid experience in all dimensions of the job seem the job function is pretty similar i think the company situation would required different my present job i feel stiff stifled in that i need to strictly say bounds of my job description really interact with people departments for example without going through my boss is not a bad person but there are limits to again and found that performed with my job and contributed a lot but promotions and pay increases are slow in from really an environment where seniority matters at least as much as performance to get a better compensation package don't have an exact figure in my mind but to move from situation that i really i would be attractive my base pay plus my bonus can also more than anyone else in my office have led my clients aggressively investments this has not only let to slightly higher returns and i more importantly tighten my relationship with them and with me with couple other managers in my office have started to work on i met with him a lot and learn from specific objectives and was constantly checking upon me i interacted directly with other departments we needed him informed of substantive issues and any interactions with other departments that this to get my best work of me and them new to educate them new friends situation you want to return profile and each month education to order same time become the clients respect them underscore this
