S09_ch1 ref  i  am  speaker  one  pleased     to    meet    you      good   to  meet  you  too  thanks   so  much  for  coming  into   cs    today    i  was  very  impressed  with  you  resume  and  ooh  i  noticed  that  your  last  job  was  just  a  few  blocks  from  here  you  must  like  this  area  while  thank  you  and  thank  you  for  seeing  me  yes  i  worked  right  up  on  street  street  state  street  i  find  it   a  good   area  to    work   in  and  an  easy  commute  for   me   so   it  appears  from  your  resume  that  both   our  your  last  two  jobs  has     a    lot  of  similarities  with  the  positions  we  have  open  yes  they   do   i   feel    very   well  prepare  for  this  opening   i   have  had  solid  experience  in  all  dimensions  of  the  job  how  would  this  job  seem  to  be  different  than  your  current  situation  while  the  job  function  is  pretty  similar  i  think  the  company  situation  would   be    quite      a    bit  different   in  my  present  job  i  feel  stiff  stifled  in  that  i  need  to  strictly  say  ***  ***  within  the  bonus  bounds   of  my  job  description  i  cant  really  interact  with  people   in  other  departments  for  example  without  going  through  my  boss   he  is  not  a  bad  person  but  there  are  limits  to  what   i   can   and   cant   do  on   my  job  any  other  things  that  you  hope  would   be  different  i  performed  well   in   my  job  and  contributed  a  lot  but  promotions  and  pay  increases  are  slow   at   my  current  firm   its  really  an  environment  where  seniority  matters  at  least  as  much  as  performance   i   had  hoped  to  get  a  better  compensation  package  what  level   of  compensation  are  you  looking   for   i   don't  have  an  exact  figure  in  my  mind  but  to  move  from  the  current  situation  that  i  would  have   to  be  secure     in     I  would  have  to  be  attractive  could  you  tell   me  what  you   are  earning  now  my  base  pay   ***   is     in     mid  nineties  plus  my  bonus  can    run   the  other  fifteen  percent   or   so  beyond  the  day   to  day  client  servicing  could  you  tell   me  about  any  particular  initiatives   of  which  you  are  particularly  proud   in   your  current  situation  more  than  anyone  else  in  my  office  have  led  my  clients  aggressively  into   ***   alternative  investments  this  has  not  only  let  to  slightly  higher  higher  returns  but  it  has  also    ***     ***   ***  decreased  their  volatility  and  i  think  more  importantly  tighten  my  relationship  with  them  and  built  their  trust  with  me   i   have  shared  this  experience  with  couple  other  managers  in  my  office  and  they  have  started  to  follow  this  model  you  mentioned  earlier  that  you  felt  somewhat  perhaps  that  word   is  stifled  by   our   current  boss  i  wonder   if  you  could  compare   or  contrast  with  your  previous  bosses  and   i   wonder   if  you  could  describe  how  you  feel  how  your  boss  could  get  your  best  work  from  you   my   previous  boss  was   great  i  met  with  him  a  lot  and  learned  from  him   a    lot   he  gave  me  specific  objectives  and  goals  and  would  always  be  there  when   i   needed  him     for     advice  but  inlike   my  current   boss     i   didnt  fell  that  he  was  constantly  checking  upon  me   he  also  was  very  comfortable  when   i   interacted  directly  with  other  departments  he  wasn't   at  all  territorial  that     way       but      i    did   keep  him  informed  of  substantive  issues  and  any  interactions  with  other  departments  that  might  matter  so  i  would  say  this  previous  boss  wasn't  excellent  model  on  how  to  get  my  best  work  out  of   me  can  you  tell   me  about  your  approach   to  clients  how  does   it  differ  from  people  around  you  and  has   it  changed  much   as  you  have  changed  employers   i    am  working  with   a   high  income  highly  educated  clientele  and  i  respect  them  like  some  of  my  colleges  i  don't  feel  that  my  job  is  to  sell  them  new  products  instead    i    fell  my  value  added  to  them  is  to  educate  them  about  new  products  and  then  let  them  decide  whether  it  works  for  them  this  client  situation   i   view  is  being  unique  each  one  has   a   different  risk     to     return  profile  and  each  one  ***  takes   a  different  amount   of  time  and  education  to  ***  get  used  considering  a  new  product   i   don't   push  products   but   at   the  same  time   my  adaption     rate      of  new  products  has  over  time  become  the  ***  highest  in  the  office   my  clients  respect  me  and   i  respect  them  my  high  referral   rate  underscore  this   i   know  you  need   to   go  you  are  here   on  your  lunch  hour  and  need   to  get  back   to  work  but   i   really  liked  what   i   have  heard   i   think  your  style  could  fit   in  exceptionally  well  and  you  could   be  very  happy  here   i   will  get  back   to  you  shortly   to  set   up  some  times  for   a   follow   up  meetings   with  some  of  my  colleges   as  well  sounds   great  i  have  heard  positive  things  about  your  firm
