S15_ch1 ok what about that is very around for i can by you have the if so i can mail you the addresses of the important documents if not then i can mail you the doc the weekend guide explained in ghouls stuff important docs at my no file ok by by the way together except for the for this should for courses which were interesting for water for think that i i am back to ok lately see if i already got the announce meetings and get consultants list working again also much back the curriculum stuff for ftp joseph and water carsten curses ground with what other info i have i'll look forward to update ok and i i get stuff for courses play all raw up the way do you should mark your other two c plus let by the with for way without them can be found through related do noisy draft and without them on ok lots of stuff for the off that and keep up ago especially to joseph for people i think that due for the classes and use as a backup lately due to do do without them by i am likely to talk with so and decide for the by look the best thing already got a programmers manual get a better basis for the do i am back to myself that i think that the best for courses which you likely to wants to with update main honcho raw lots of water on the mail page nice that due look forward to the comments on the docs i'll for the weekend to
