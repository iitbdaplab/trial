S15_ch1 ok around for you have the if so i can mail you the important documents if not then i can mail you the doc the weekend guide ghouls stuff important docs at my know ok by by the way except for the for this should for courses which were interesting for all the ok see if i announce meetings and get consultants list working again also stuff for ftp joseph and water carsten curses ground with what other info i have look forward to update i stuff for all raw do you should mark the other two c plus list by the with provided without them on to do no interaction without them on ok lots of stuff to off guys keep up especially to joseph and decide for the classes and use as a backup lately due to do without them i am talk with some and decide for the best thing already got a programmers manual better basis for the do i am back to myself that i think that the best likely to with main honcho trauma gustavo on that me page nice that due look forward much on the docs i'll for the weekend
