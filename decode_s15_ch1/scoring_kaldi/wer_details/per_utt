S15_ch1 ref  carsten  hasnt  got  any   of  that  due   to  lack   of  inf   o   also  wrt  the  curriculum  transcripts  you  got  the  mail  and  will   be  able   to  fit  the  files   in  sturgeons  hierarchy   i   assume  yup  just  tar   it  and  put   it   in   an  ftp  file  when   do  you  think  you  can  get   a   first  draft  out  when  can  everyone  mail   me  absolutely  all  documentation  mail  the  www  guide  and  the  info  note   on  the  moo   to  yourself  that's   it  absolutely  all  documentation   is  absolutely  too  much   i   don't  have  the  time  for  all  the  selective  ftping  and   i   have   to  then  mail  everything   on   to  myself  which  takes  another  day   to  download  ok   i   will  send  you  what   i   can  reach  today  what  about  www  can  you  read  the  mosaic  josephs  doc  carsten  curses  his  predicament   i   will   not  be  much  around  for  two   to  three  months  after  monday  then  for   a   first  draft  the  transcripts   of  the  curriculum  stuff  you  should  have  the  gna  www  documents  are  all  raw  html  i  once  converted  old  versions   to   ps  and  put  them   on  ftp  this  should   be  done  again  that   is  fast  do  you  have  www  if  so  i  can  mail  you  the  addresses  of  the  important  documents  if  not  then  i  can  mail  you  the  docs  themselves  hmtl  how  does  www  work  hypertext  markup  language   i   mail  you   my    www    guide  after  carsten  www   is  explained  in  ghouls  stuff  ill  email  the  important  docs  at  my  end  no   do   it  yourself  ill  need  everything   in  pure  text  when  you  have  got   a   first  draft  you  can  email   it   to  the  curriculum  list  and   we  can  talk  about   it  next  saturday  okay  fine  what  happened   to   the  list  by  the  way   it  became  dead   it    seems   except  for  the  suggestions  for  courses  which  were  interesting  this  should  liven  things   up   so  what  about  right  how  many  gna  faqs    are    there  maybe    carsten    can  informally  coordinate   gna   curriculum  until  i  am  back  to   vr  together  with  joseph  please   i    am  too  new   to   this  ok  let    me    see  if  i  have  all  the  projects  straight  has  also  volunteered  some  time  ago   to  participate   in   a    draft   for  the  curriculum   i   don't  know  how  much   he  really  wants   to  get  involved  though  but   it   is  nice  that   he   is  not   a    cs   or  natural  science  person  edit  transcript   of  this  meeting  carsten  writeup  gna  faq   me  announce  meetings  and  get  consultants  list  working  again  get  global  village   up  and  running  finish  thesis  and  prepare  for  teaching  programming  class  next  semester  will  pack  the  curriculum  stuff  for  ftp  joseph  and  water  carsten  carstens  ground  with  what  other  info  i  have  laying  around  thank   you  don't   forget  to  update  the  www  page  ok  and  ill  add  his  stuff   to  the  hierachy  also  ill  see   if  i  can  get   a   course  catalog  together   by  next  saturday  which  should   be  appended   to  the  faq   he  wonders  what   role   he    will   play   in  the  gna  concept   i   will  mail  the  litprog  class  proposal  today   to   be  included  you  should  mark   the  other  two  c  plus  ***  plus  parallel  with  ***  ***  provided  collaborators  can  be  found  through  related  ***  newsgroups    no   interaction  without  them   i   mean  with  interlude  actually   i   think  that  the  course  catalog  should   be   a   separate  documents  for  now  since  its  likely   to   be  very  heavily  revised  ok  lots  of  stuff   to   do  i  am  off  guys  thanks  for  the  meeting  and  keep  up  the  good  work  especially  thanks  to  joseph  for  keeping  the  organization  together  i  think   we  can  tenetatively  plan   to   use  interlude  for  the  classes  and  use  as  a  backup  explain  interlude  the  question   is  continue  working   on  the  gna  lab   or  start  learning  interlude  full  speed   if  there  are  serious  problems  with  using  global  village  and  interlude   we  should  be  aware     of    them  by  early  january  and  this  will  give   us  enough  time   to  switch  i  think  the  best  thing    is    to  talk  with  some  more  and  decide  for  yourself  where  your  time  would   be  best  spent    i    already  got  a  programmers  manual   he  seems   to  think  that  interlude   is  a  better  basis  for  inter  moo  communications  i  don't  know  enough  about  that  to  comment   on  that  okay  people  ill  email  you  for  some  things  and  questions  that  i  have  i  just  think  that   me  writing  the  faq  might   be   a   good  idea  since   i   have   to  ask   as   well  perhaps   the   best   thing  to   do    is   to  post  the  question   on  the  gna  tech  list  and  see  what  consensus  emerges  who   is   the  techincal  main  honcho  trauma  gustavo  here   or  colman  gna  tech   is  very  silent  lately  carsten  means  the  most  well  versed  person  so  is  the  curriculum  one  really  then   we  need   to  make   it   noisy  again  ill  look  forward  to  the  comments  on  the  first  draft  after  the  weekend  then  bye  guys  should   we  adjourn  the  meeting
