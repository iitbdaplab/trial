S15_ch1 you have the important documents if not then i can mail you the docs at my know by except for this should for courses which were interesting ok see if i announce meetings and get consultants list working again of stuff for ftp joseph and water carsten other info i stuff for inter together by the with provided without them on to do no interaction without them on ok lots of that especially to joseph and decide for the classes and use as a backup due to talk with and decide for the best thing better basis for the due to likely to main honcho on that due look forward doc
