S01_ch1 most of the mathematical notation in use today was not invented until the sixteenth century before that mathematics was written out in words limiting mathematical discovery euler seventeen zero seven to seventeen eighty three was responsible for many of the notations in use today modern notation makes mathematics much easier for the professional but beginners often find it daunting according to barbara oakley this can be attributed to the fact that mathematical ideas are both more abstract and more encrypted than those of natural language unlike natural language where people can often equate a word such as cow with the physical object it corresponds to mathematical symbols are abstract lacking any physical analog mathematical symbols are also more highly encrypted than regular words meaning a single symbol can encode a number of different operations or ideas moreover mathematical language can be difficult to understand for beginners because common terms such as or and only have more precise meanings than in everyday speech and other common terms such as open and field refer to specific mathematical ideas not related to their usual meanings mathematical language also includes many technical terms such as homeomorphism and integrable that have no meaning outside of mathematics in a literal sense the term modern physics means up to date physics in this sense a significant portion of so called classical physics is modern however since roughly eighteen nighty new discoveries have caused significant paradigm shifts the advent of quantum mechanics qm and of einsteinian relativity er physics that incorporates elements of either qm or er or both is said to be modern physics it is in this latter sense that the term is generally used modern physics is often encountered when dealing with extreme conditions quantum mechanical effects tend to appear when dealing with lows low temperatures small distances while relativistic effects tend to appear when dealing with highs high velocities large distances the middles being classical behaviour for example when analyzing the behaviour of a gas at room temperature most phenomena will involve the classical maxwell boltzmann distribution however near absolute zero the maxwell boltzmann distribution fails to account for the observed behaviour of the gas and the modern fermi dirac or bose einstein distributions have to be used instead very often it is possible to find the classical behaviour by analyzing the modern description at low speeds and large distances when doing so the result is called the classical limit astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena it applies mathematics physics and chemistry in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution objects of interest include planets moons stars galaxies and comets the phenomena include supernova explosions gamma ray bursts and cosmic microwave background radiation more generally all phenomena that originate outside earths atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy a related but distinct subject physical cosmology is concerned with the study of the universe as a whole astronomy is one of the oldest of the natural sciences the early civilizations in recorded history such as the babylonians greeks indians egyptians nubians iranians chinese maya and many ancient indigenous peoples of the americas performed methodical observations of the night sky historically astronomy has included disciplines as diverse as astrometry celestial navigation observational astronomy and the making of calendars but professional astronomy is now often considered to be synonymous with astrophysics during the twentieth century the field of professional astronomy split into observational and theoretical branches observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects which is then analyzed using basic principles of physics
