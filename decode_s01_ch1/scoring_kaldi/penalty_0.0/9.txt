S01_ch1 modern notation makes mathematics much find often find it don't fact that mathematical ideas are both more abstract and more encrypted than those of natural language where people can often equate a word such as cow with the physical object it corresponds to mathematical symbols are abstract lacking any again mathematical symbols are also more highly no meaning a thing in order number of moreover mathematical language can be one of the mug because common terms such as or and only have more precise meanings than in everyday speech and other common terms such as open and field refer to specific mathematical ideas not name may don't get more sense the term modern physics means up to date physics in this sense a significant portion of so called a lot more than however since roughly eighteen nineteen new discoveries have caused significant paradigm shifts the advent of quantum mechanics and all i think that incorporates elements of either on and similar or both is said to be modern physics it in this latter sense that the term is generally modern physics is often encountered when dealing with extreme conditions quantum mechanical effects tend to appear when dealing with lows low and asia morning by the way it thing to appear when dealing with highs high will not the meeting being classical for example when analyzing the year of a gas at room temperature most phenomena will involve the classical maxwell war mainly evolution at all in order also we are gas and the modern meter on and versions to will find last year analyzing the modern description at noon not when doing so the result is called the classical limit all give all all your all all all all all all all all us
