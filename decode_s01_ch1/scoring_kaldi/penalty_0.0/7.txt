S01_ch1 modern notation makes mathematics much not find it often find it don't according ally fact that mathematical what abstract and more encrypted than those of natural language natural language where people can often equate a word such as cow with the physical object it corresponds to mathematical symbols are abstract lacking any again mathematical symbols are also more highly in words meaning a thing in order number of this should moreover mathematical language can be one of the mug because common terms such as or and only have more precise meanings than in everyday speech and other common terms such as open and field refer to specific mathematical ideas not name match may don't get more is in this sense the term modern physics means up to date physics in this sense a significant portion of so called a lot specific more than however since us me eighteen nineteen you this so they have caused significant paradigm shifts the advent of quantum mechanics and all and related we physics that incorporates elements of either on any on and similar or both is said to be modern physics it in this latter sense that the term is generally modern physics is often encountered when dealing with extreme conditions quantum mechanical effects tend to appear when dealing with noon note and asia morning by the way ill it thing to appear when dealing with highs high will not the meeting being classical easier for example when analyzing the year of a gas at room temperature most phenomena will involve the classical maxwell war mainly evolution however near absolute zero the maxwell in order also we are gas and the modern for me that on and and versions to you mail on find last year na analyzing the modern description at noon and not when doing so the result is called the classical limit all give all all your all all all all all all all all all all us
