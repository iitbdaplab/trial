S09_mvdr_ta i as you i am speaker one pleased to time so much for coming into yesterday i was very impressed with your resume and i noticed last job was just few blocks from you must like this area thank you for seeing me on street street state street if i can easy commute for them that both last job lot of similarities positions we have open just for this opening solid experience all dimensions of the job this job seem situation job function similar i think the company situation would required different present job i feel stiff stifled in that i need to strictly say bounds of my job description really interact with people other departments for example without going through my boss is not a bad person but there are limits to order to on the any other things performed my job and contributed a lot but promotions and pay increases are slow in my current firm really an environment where seniority matters at least as performance to get a better compensation package don't have an exact figure in my mind but to move from situation that i have to be attractive my base pay the meeting bonus can also more than anyone else in my led my clients aggressively into alternative investments this has not only let to slightly higher returns be more importantly tighten my relationship with them and built us with couple other managers in my office have started to follow this boss was good i met with and learned to specific objectives and was or like are constantly checking upon me also comfortable interacted directly with other departments that we needed him informed of substantive issues any interactions with other departments that this on how to my best work income highly to sell them them them new them decide whether you want to return profile and each month time and education to new zealand or time become the highest in my clients respect them
