S09_mvdr_ta speaker do i as you i am speaker one pleased to meet you to meet you time so much for coming into yesterday i was very impressed with your resume all and i noticed that your last job was just a few blocks from your you must like this area thank you and thank you for seeing me on street street state street if i can easy commute for them that both our your last job have a lot of similarities with the positions we have open just do for this opening had solid experience in all mention for the job how would this job seem the current situation the job function is pretty similar i think the company situation would required to be different my present job i feel stiff stifled in that i need to strictly say bounds of my job description i cant really interact with people in other departments for example without going through my boss is not a bad person but there are limits to again and found on the job any other things that you were performed well my job and contributed a lot but promotions and pay increases are slow in my current firm its really an environment where seniority matters at least as much as performance had hoped to get a better compensation package don't have an exact figure in my mind but to move from situation that i really i will have to be attractive my base pay the meeting with my bonus can also more than anyone else in my office have led my clients aggressively into alternative investments this has not only let to slightly higher returns but it is nice more importantly tighten my relationship with them and built us with me have shared this couple other managers in my office have started to follow this more boss was used was good i met with him a lot and learn from him a lot to specific objectives and was we needed him for like are worth was constantly checking upon me also comfortable when i interacted directly with other departments that we need keep him informed of substantive issues and any interactions with other departments that might matter would this model on how to get my best work me income highly respect them to sell them you my value added to them is educate them about new products and a wizard will be one of the noon to return profile and each different amount of time and education to considering a new zealand persian as or time become the highest in my clients respect them
