S09_mvdr_ta speaker do i as you i am speaker one pleased to meet you to meet you time so much for coming into yesterday i was very impressed with your resume all and i noticed that your last job was just a few blocks from your you must like this area right thank you and thank you for seeing me i worked right up on street street state street i find it a good work in easy commute for them so the us from your resume that both of your last two jobs have a lot of similarities with the positions we have open just the new for this opening have heard solid experience in all mention for the job how would this job seem the modern situation rather job function is released similar i think the company situation would required to be different my present job i feel stiff stifled in that i need to strictly say resume bounds of my job description i cant really interact with people in other departments for example without going through my boss is not a bad person but there are limits to what i can and cant do on the job any other things that you were performed well in my job and contributed a lot but promotions and pay increases are slow in my current firm its really an environment where seniority matters at least as much as performance had hoped to get a better compensation package level of compensation i don't have an exact figure in my mind but to move from the current situation that i am very secure in i will have to be attractive my base pay the mid nine this plus my bonus can is really don't on other fifteen percent also things me about any more than anyone else in my office have led my clients aggressively into alternative investments this has not only let to slightly higher returns but it is also be there is the will italy and i think more importantly tighten my relationship with them and built us with me have shared this with couple other managers in my office have started to follow this more boss was good from your boss was good i met with him a lot and learned from him a lot to specific objectives and was always be there and i needed him for with what unlike are worth do that we will constantly checking upon me also comfortable when i interacted directly with other departments he was hundred all that we need keep him informed of substantive issues and any interactions with other departments that might matter would this previous boss within more on how to get my best work of me and will be reason income highly educated ground respect them some of my colleges i don't feel to sell them you the my value added to them is to educate them about new products and than them decide whether it works for them is ground view is being you each one of the noon to return profile and each one takes a different among the final division to get used to considering a new product i don't which were of whether in same name or the positions we are the middle as or time become the highest in the office my clients respect me for them my high referral rate underscore this will give all those things of all
