S09_mvdr_ta speaker do you i am speaker one pleased to meet you time so much for coming into yesterday i was very impressed with your resume and i noticed that your last job was just few blocks from you must like this area thank you and thank you for seeing me on street street state street if i can easy commute for them that both our your last job have a lot of similarities with the positions we have open just for this opening had solid experience in all dimensions of the job this job seem the current situation the job function is pretty similar i think the company situation would required to be different my present job i feel stiff stifled in that i need to strictly say bounds of my job description really interact with people in other departments for example without going through my boss is not a bad person but there are limits to work in two hundred or any other things performed well my job and contributed a lot but promotions and pay increases are slow in my current firm really an environment where seniority matters at least as much as performance had hoped to get a better compensation package don't have an exact figure in my mind but to move from situation that i have to be attractive my base pay the meeting with my bonus can also more than anyone else in my office have led my clients aggressively into alternative investments this has not only let to slightly higher returns but also more importantly tighten my relationship with them and built us with couple other managers in my office have started to follow this more boss was good i met with him a lot and learned to specific objectives and was we needed him for like are was constantly checking upon me also comfortable when i interacted directly with other departments that we need keep him informed of substantive issues and any interactions with other departments that this model on how to get my best work income highly to sell them you my value added to educate them about new products and a wizard will be one of the noon to return profile and each month time and education to new zealand and the creation of time become the highest in my clients respect them
