S09_mvdr_ta i am speaker one pleased to meet you good to meet you too thanks so much for coming into cs today i was very impressed with you resume and ooh i noticed that your last job was just a few blocks from here you must like this area while thank you and thank you for seeing me yes i worked right up on street street state street i find it a good area to work in and an easy commute for me so it appears from your resume that both our your last two jobs has a lot of similarities with the positions we have open yes they do i feel very well prepare for this opening i have had solid experience in all dimensions of the job how would this job seem to be different than your current situation while the job function is pretty similar i think the company situation would be quite a bit different in my present job i feel stiff stifled in that i need to strictly say within the bonus bounds of my job description i cant really interact with people in other departments for example without going through my boss he is not a bad person but there are limits to what i can and cant do on my job any other things that you hope would be different i performed well in my job and contributed a lot but promotions and pay increases are slow at my current firm its really an environment where seniority matters at least as much as performance i had hoped to get a better compensation package what level of compensation are you looking for i don't have an exact figure in my mind but to move from the current situation that i would have to be secure in I would have to be attractive could you tell me what you are earning now my base pay is in mid nineties plus my bonus can run the other fifteen percent or so beyond the day to day client servicing could you tell me about any particular initiatives of which you are particularly proud in your current situation more than anyone else in my office have led my clients aggressively into alternative investments this has not only let to slightly higher higher returns but it has also decreased their volatility and i think more importantly tighten my relationship with them and built their trust with me i have shared this experience with couple other managers in my office and they have started to follow this model you mentioned earlier that you felt somewhat perhaps that word is stifled by our current boss i wonder if you could compare or contrast with your previous bosses and i wonder if you could describe how you feel how your boss could get your best work from you my previous boss was great i met with him a lot and learned from him a lot he gave me specific objectives and goals and would always be there when i needed him for advice but inlike my current boss i didnt fell that he was constantly checking upon me he also was very comfortable when i interacted directly with other departments he wasn't at all territorial that way but i did keep him informed of substantive issues and any interactions with other departments that might matter so i would say this previous boss wasn't excellent model on how to get my best work out of me can you tell me about your approach to clients how does it differ from people around you and has it changed much as you have changed employers i am working with a high income highly educated clientele and i respect them like some of my colleges i don't feel that my job is to sell them new products instead i fell my value added to them is to educate them about new products and then let them decide whether it works for them this client situation i view is being unique each one has a different risk to return profile and each one takes a different amount of time and education to get used considering a new product i don't push products but at the same time my adaption rate of new products has over time become the highest in the office my clients respect me and i respect them my high referral rate underscore this i know you need to go you are here on your lunch hour and need to get back to work but i really liked what i have heard i think your style could fit in exceptionally well and you could be very happy here i will get back to you shortly to set up some times for a follow up meetings with some of my colleges as well sounds great i have heard positive things about your firm
