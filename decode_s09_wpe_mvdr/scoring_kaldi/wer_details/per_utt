S09_mvdr_ta ref    ***    ***  ***  ***  ***  i  am  speaker  one  pleased  to  meet  you  good  to  meet  you  too  thanks  so  much  for  coming  into   cs    today    i  was  very  impressed  with   you  resume  and  ooh  i  noticed  that  your  last  job  was  just  a  few  blocks  from  here  you  must  like  this  area  while  thank  you  and  thank  you  for  seeing  me  yes  i  worked  right  up  on  street  street  state  street  i  find  it  a  good  area   to  work  in  and   an  easy  commute  for   me   so   it  appears  from  your  resume  that  both  our  your  last  two  jobs   has  a  lot  of  similarities  with  the  positions  we  have  open  yes  they   do   i   feel  very  well  prepare  for  this  opening   i   have   had   solid  experience  in  all  dimensions   of  the  job  how  would  this  job  seem   to   be  different  than  your  current  situation  while    the   job  function  is   pretty   similar  i  think  the  company  situation  would   be    quite    a  bit  different   in  my  present  job  i  feel  stiff  stifled  in  that  i  need  to  strictly  say  within  the   bonus  bounds  of  my  job  description  i  cant  really  interact  with  people  in  other  departments  for  example  without  going  through  my  boss   he  is  not  a  bad  person  but  there  are  limits  to  what  i  can  and  cant  do  on   my  job  any  other  things  that  you  hope  would   be  different    i   performed  well  in  my  job  and  contributed  a  lot  but  promotions  and  pay  increases  are  slow  at  my  current  firm  its  really  an  environment  where  seniority  matters  at  least  as  much  as  performance   i   had  hoped  to  get  a  better  compensation  package  what  level  of  compensation  are  you  looking  for  i  don't  have  an  exact  figure  in  my  mind  but  to  move  from  the  current  situation  that  i  would  have  to   be   secure  in  I  would  have  to  be  attractive  could  you  tell   me  what  you  are  earning  now  my  base  pay   is   in   mid  nineties  plus  my  bonus  can  ***    ***    run   the  other  fifteen  percent   or   so  beyond  the  day   to  day  client  servicing  could   you   tell   me  about  any  particular  initiatives   of  which  you  are  particularly  proud   in  your  current  situation  more  than  anyone  else  in  my  office  have  led  my  clients  aggressively  into  alternative  investments  this  has  not  only  let  to  slightly  higher  higher  returns  but  it  has  also  ***   ***   ***  decreased  their  volatility  and  i  think  more  importantly  tighten  my  relationship  with  them  and  built  their  trust  with  me   i   have  shared  this  experience  with  couple  other  managers  in  my  office  and  they  have  started  to  follow  this  model  you  mentioned  earlier  that  you  felt  somewhat  perhaps  that  word   is  stifled   by  our  current  boss   i   wonder   if  you  could  compare   or  contrast  with  your  previous  bosses  and   i   wonder   if  you  could  describe  how  you  feel  how  your  boss  could  get  your  best  work  from  you   my  previous  boss  was  great  i  met  with  him  a  lot  and  learned  from  him  a  lot   he  gave  me  specific  objectives  and  goals  and  would  always  be  there  when  i  needed  him  for  advice  but  inlike   my   current   boss    i   didnt  fell  that  he   was  constantly  checking  upon  me   he  also  was  very  comfortable  when  i  interacted  directly  with  other  departments  he  wasn't     at    all  territorial  that  way  but   i   did  keep  him  informed  of  substantive  issues  and  any  interactions  with  other  departments  that  might  matter   so   i   would  say  this  previous  boss  wasn't  excellent  model  on  how  to  get  my  best  work  out  of   me  can  you  tell  me  about  your  approach   to  clients  how  does   it  differ  from  people  around  you  and  has   it  changed  much   as  you  have  changed  employers   i    am  working  with   a   high   income  highly  educated  clientele  and     i    respect  them  like  some  of  my  colleges  i  don't  feel  that   my  job   is  to  sell  them  new  products  instead   i   fell  my  value  added  to  them  is  to  educate  them  about  new  products  and  then   let  them  decide  whether  it  works  for  them  this  client  situation     i    view  is  being  unique  each  one  has   a  different  risk  to  return  profile  and  each  one  takes  a  different  amount    of   time   and   education  to  get  used  ***  considering  a  new  product  i  don't   push  products  but     at    the  same   ***  time   my   adaption  rate   of  new  products  has  over  time  become  the  highest  in  the  office  my  clients  respect  me  and   i   respect  them  my  high  referral  rate  underscore  this   i   know  you  need   to   go  you  are  here   on  your  lunch  hour  and  need   to  get  back   to  work  but   i   really  liked  what   i   have  heard   i   think  your  style  could  fit   in  exceptionally  well  and  you  could   be  very  happy  here   i   will  get  back   to  you  shortly   to  set   up  some  times  for   a   follow   up  meetings  with  some   of   my  colleges   as  well  sounds  great   i   have  heard  positive  things  about  your  firm
